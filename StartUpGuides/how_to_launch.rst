How to Launch Aviatrix
=============================================

Aviatrix Secure Networking Platform consists of two components, Controller and
gateway. The Controller is launched first. From the Controller browser console, gateways are launched using your cloud account credentials with cloud provider APIs.

There are two ways to launch and manage the Controller. 

 1. The Controller can be launched and managed by us via `Aviatrix Hosted Service <https://www.aviatrix.com/trial/>`_. With this method, you have one less instance of infrastructure software to maintain and manage. While you still retain the control, Aviatrix can provide proactive assistance with software upgrades. 

 2. The Controller can be launched and managed by you using AMI in your AWS account.  The Controller AMI is available in `AWS Marketplace, <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_  `Azure Marketplace <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/azure-aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_ and `GCloud <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/google-aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_.
