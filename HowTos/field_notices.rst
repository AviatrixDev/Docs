-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**SSL UserVPN with SAML function might fail with Chrome v70**
 
Problem:
Remote users connecting via SSL UserVPN functionality authenticated through SAML cannot establish session.
 
Description:
Aviatrix controllers and gateways provide SSL UserVPN service with authentication through SAML as described in `this doc <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/VPN_SAML.html>`_. Google Chrome v70 has altered the behavior of an element in HTML (they add an extra whitespace). This affects our productâ€™s ability to interface with the SAML id providers and breaks the authentication process, resulting in remoteVPN users not being able to connect to your network. We have notified Google about this issue.
 
Solution:
Customers deploying SSL UserVPN with SAML authentication are requested to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later, if they are running 3.3 or later release. Please follow the instructions here to perform the software upgrade. For software version prior to 3.3, please reach out to us at support@aviatrix.com. Another workaround to restore the service to your users is to use Firefox as their default browser.

**Route update propagation inconsistency from on-premise networks affecting 3.5 releases prior to 3.5.362 for Transit Network**
 
Problem:
BGP Route propagation could fail intermittently from on-premise networks to cloud networks in Transit Network.
 
Description:
Aviatrix controllers and gateways use BGP to summarize and propagate the network routes. Due to an unexpected software change, 3.5 releases prior to 3.5.362 are affected and cannot forward routes in certain scenarios. This issue has been addressed in 3.5.362 and all customers who have deployed Transit Network and are running any 3.5 release prior to 3.5.362 are advised to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later, immediately. Customers who are running software version prior to 3.5 are not impacted by this issue.
 
Solution:
Customers deploying Transit Network are requested to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later, if they are running any 3.5.(<362) release. Please follow the instructions here to perform the software upgrade.
