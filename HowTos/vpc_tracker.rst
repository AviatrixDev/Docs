VPC Tracker
###################################

VPC Tracker is a tool that collects and helps you manage your network CIDR ranges at a central place. No need to keep an Excel sheet on 
all your VPC network addresses allocations. 

No gateway launches required. Just add all your `other AWS accounts <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/aviatrix_account.html>`_ on the Controller, VPC Tracker will retrieve the information. 

VPC Tracker auto updates once a day. You can do on-demand update by clicking the refresh button. 

If you are planning to `create a new VPC <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/create_vpc.html>`_, you can first check CIDR overlap by entering the CIDR block and click Test. The result displays the overlapping CIDRs for your reference.
