TGW Orchestrator Design Patterns
=========================================================

Full mesh network design
--------------------------

If you like to build a full mesh network that allows all VPCs and on-prem to communicate with each other, you do not need to create any custom Security Domains. Simply use the built-in Default_Domain and Aviatrix_Edge_Domain for the deployment, as shown below. 

|default_domain_design|

At Plan page Step 2, select "Full mesh network". 


Fully Isolated network design
------------------------------

If you like to build a fully isolated network where no VPC can communicate with each other except to the shared service VPC and on-prem, you need to create a Security Domain for each VPC and connect each domain to the Shared_Service_Domain. 

|fully_isolated_network_design|

In this network design, you need to create a custom Security Domain for each VPC. 

At the Plan page Step 2, select "Create Custom Security Domain" and fill in the information. Make sure you multi select Shared_Service_Domain and Aviatrix_Edge_Domain for "Connect to Security Domains".. Repeat this step for each VPC. 


Full mesh network with Distributed Egress Control Design
----------------------------------------------------------

You may expand the full mesh network to include Aviatrix distributed Egress FQDN in each VPC, as shown below.

|default_egress|

Follow the instructions for `FQDN <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/FQDN_Whitelists_Ref_Design.html>`_ to deploy egress control funct
ion.
