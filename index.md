## Introduction

The enterprise journey to cloud adoption can be driven by two different types of incentives.  The business drives one type, building new, transformative capabilities.  
Here the cloud is an enabler that has become more accessible. 
 The other type is focused on optimizing the legacy data center environments within IT.  
 These two types are usually happening in parallel.  
 In all cases, cloud adoption is accelerating, and along with it an increasing number of challenges.

Migrating, deploying and running applications in the cloud is amongst the top priorities of every CIO. Massive application workloads like Enterprise Resource Planning applications (ERP), large custom applications, high performance computing applications and backup and disaster recovery applications are migrating to the public cloud. Most enterprises are stepping into the cloud with a hybrid approach. Aviatrix for Hybrid Cloud enables enterprises to design, configure and operate secure and scalable hybrid cloud networks to migrate, access and run applications in the public cloud.

Aviatrix for Hybrid Cloud eliminates the complexity of connecting to and across public clouds and VPCs (Virtual Public Cloud) with a simple mesh architecture. Aviatrix is fully integrated with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.


## Business Reasons
This is a typical list of CIO and enterprise motives that drive the move of enterprise applications to the cloud.
###New business models
>•	pay-as-you-go flexibility to expand / reduce IT footprint as needed

>•	untested workloads, “fail-fast, fail-cheap” POC’s
###New application architectures
>•	design new apps for the cloud day1
###Disaster recovery and high availability
>•	geo-dispersed sites

>•	system redundancy

>•	significantly easier and automated periodic testing
###Cost savings
>•	especially storage costs
>•	limited IT staff and resource growth
>•	temporary spikes in capacity demands
###International expansion and collaboration
>•	M&A activities resulting in geographically dispersed disparate systems 
>•	Expansion into new global markets
###Compelling events
>•	Expiring data center equipment support
>•	Expiring data center leases
###Compliance
>•	Requirements for local data hosting in the region being served vs centralized
